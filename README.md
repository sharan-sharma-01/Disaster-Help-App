# 🚨 Disaster Help App

A life-saving web app that connects people in emergencies to nearby NGOs and emergency services — fast, direct, and simple.

## 🧠 About the Project

During natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or building collapses, people in danger often call the police or emergency helplines. But help can be delayed because the police usually forward the case to local NGOs.

**Our solution?**  
Cut the delay. This app connects victims **directly** to **registered NGOs** in their area with just one tap.
